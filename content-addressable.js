/*
Now here is a non contrived example.

This is a content addressable store - it's CA store
is like a KeyValue store, except you do not get to
choose the key, the key is always the hash of the value.

This is a really good idea for a bunch of reasons.
You data becomes immutable (cannot change), which means
caching works perfectly (no cache invalidation).
Also, if you know the hash you want, you can verify
you have the correct data no matter who give it to you.

These features make building a distributed system very
easy, and is why you see this pattern in git, bittorrent,
and bitcoin.
